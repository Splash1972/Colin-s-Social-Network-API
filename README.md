# Project Details:

This week's challenge is to use the Mongoose models and sync to a MongoDB database.

The idea is to create a database that stores information much like a social media site might. 
Here, we can add a user, add a thought to that user, have reactions to those thoughts, and search through all of those things by single user, or by all users or thoughts together.

Here's a screenshot of Postman during testing:
